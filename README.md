# PresenceDetector_Clock
## Presence detection with clock<br>
This code supports an Arduino PRO mini located on a Multi-Purpose PCB which was designed by Makerspace Wiesbaden in order to support many applications.<br>Those PCBs contain all usually required components which are assembled as required.<br><br>The PCB also provides space to accommodate XBEE/ZBEE S2C Module from Digi which acts as a Zigbee Network Router in order to communicate with the XBEE/ZBEE Module on our Raspberry Main Controller - configured as a Coordinator. This setup is giving the advantage of Zigbee Meshing via many other controller boards.

Major function of this application is an emulated Analog clock build with 60 RGB-LEDs mounted in a circle with a diameter of about 40cm
